*Fire Lines: Exploring the Legacy of 1910's Great Fire in the Northwest* was written by Isabel Marlens as an MFA internship project in 2022/23 with support from [Leah Hampton](https://leahkhampton.com/) (Environmental Humanities and Creative Writing Fellow in Residence at [the Confluence Lab](https://www.theconfluencelab.org/stories-of-fire-atlas)) and [Evan Peter Williamson](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/ewilliamson.html) (Co-Director of the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/)).
The web site was built using a customized [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) template with features to support a multimodal essay weaving the presentation writing and archival objects together.
