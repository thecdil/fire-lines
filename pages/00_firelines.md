### 1. 2020

.

In the summer of 2020, a lot of us had a sense that the world was burning in unprecedented ways.  

Most of us living in the Western United States saw smoke, at least—for weeks and weeks. A lot of us saw flames. I have a distinct memory from September of 2020 of driving on a busy freeway, along the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California, and watching orange fire race up the mountainside beneath a mid-afternoon sky literally as dark as night. I was listening to news of the pandemic, and of the coming presidential elections, and trying to think of movie scenes that were quite so stereotypically apocalyptic, as a tactical aircraft released a stream of scarlet chemical retardant across my field of vision.

Fires burned more than 10.2 million acres in the Western U.S. during the 2020 fire season, and caused nearly 20 billion dollars in damages. Smoke darkened the sky—as far east as New York; and the media made much of this, for it felt like everywhere we looked, the climate crisis was manifest. Many people lost their homes, and some of these people tragically remain unhoused. The extremity of the situation was increased by the public health and economic crises brought on by Covid-19—and by social divisions, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of June 2020, and leading up to November’s election. 

Rumors flew on social media that members of “Antifa” had left Portland to start fires in rural eastern Oregon. The news reported on militia-men, guarding their burning towns with trucks and guns, prepared to fight off all outsiders and confused by the acronym BLM—which is shared, of course, by the Black Lives Matter movement and another of their longtime enemies, The Bureau of Land Management.

It was easy to feel like the situation was unprecedented, even traumatic. In some ways it was; a certain portion of humanity has changed the climate. Now we’re learning about the consequences. And yet, you could also say that history is full of examples of similarly apocalyptic times (some, as we’ll soon see, involving fire). History also explains exactly why we are now living in a fire age. And though it is inextricably linked to climate change, it has at least as much to do with the history of colonization.

### 2. 1910

{% include essay/figure.html objectid="im-01" %}

In her 2021 article, "‘Fire is medicine’: How Indigenous practices could help curb wildfires," Casey Kuhn quotes Frank Lake, a forest scientist, holder of traditional knowledge, and descendant of the Karuk Tribe, whose lands are in what is colonially considered far northern California, near the border with Oregon. Lake explains: “We have to question the narrative of history that has demonized fire, coming from a colonial perspective.” 

Lake could easily be speaking to the whole history of European colonization; but in the context of Kuhn’s article, he happens to be referring to the fallout of a specific, formative event—many have said the most formative—when it comes to shaping the modern firescape of the American West: the Great Fire of 1910. 

The Great Fire (also sometimes called the Big Burn, Big Blowup, or the Devil’s Broom Fire) began with many small fires as early as June, 1910, and reached its climax on the 20th of August, with the arrival of hurricane-force winds. It burned a still-astonishing three million acres across Idaho, western Montana, and eastern Washington, much of that over the course of just two days.

A 1911 paper by the forester E.T. Allen, Handling the Fire Peril, called 1910 “probably the worst fire year in American history—a year when no rain fell for months, when the winds were veritable hurricanes, when fires sprang up everywhere and were numbered not by hundreds but by thousands…” Another forester, Edward G. Stahl, wrote of flames “hundreds of feet high and fanned by a tornadic wind so violent that the flames flattened out ahead, swooping to earth in great darting curves, truly a veritable red demon from hell.” The smoke could be seen in New England, and soot settled as far away as Greenland. The silver-mining town of Wallace, Idaho was largely destroyed, and several smaller towns were burned down to nothing.

The University of Idaho’s Special Collections hold a hand-typed copy of a document called History of 1910 Forest Fires in Idaho and Western Montana, by the pioneering forester Elers Koch. It begins: “If history is not written it is soon forgotten. The 1910 forest fire in the Northern Rocky Mountain Region is an episode which has had much to do with shaping the fire policy not only of that region but of the whole United States. The tragic and disastrous culmination of that battle to save the forests shocked the nation into a realization of the necessity of a better system of fire control.” He goes on to provide firsthand accounts of men fighting the fire on many different fronts. 

{% include essay/marginnote-image.html id="tellus-note" text="History of 1910 Forest Fires in Idaho and Western Montana." image="im-02"%}


These largely focus on the terror of it. Between August 20th and 21st 1910, at least eighty-five people died as a result of the fire. Many more reportedly lost their minds with fear.

One group of men, realizing that the fire was inevitably going to overtake them, were ordered by their leader to wet their bedding in a spring and lie down beneath it. “They had hardly done this,” Koch explains, “when the fire swept over them. At this juncture, two of the men apparently lost their reason completely, jumped up, threw off their bedding, rushed into the fire, and burned to death only a few yards from where the rest of the men lay.”

In a different place, one man slipped off into the darkness, as “columns of smoke,” which often “burst into flames, shot thousands of feet” into the sky. “Even though two shots were heard,” Koch writes, “it was not understood until the following morning that he had taken his own life.”

Another group of nineteen men, “thoroughly panic stricken,” broke off from the rest of their crew in fear, disobeying their captain, and took refuge in a “little cabin.” Eighteen of those men were lost to the flames, and were found the next day—along with five horses and “a large black bear,” who had all perished in the same place.

The story of a man named Ed Thenon—captain of the Moose Creek Crew—grips me the most. Thenon went to bed with his men in darkness and quiet, imagining them all to be many miles from the line of the fire. A little after 10 p.m., one of Thenon’s crew called him out of his tent — to observe what he thought must be stars, falling on a hillside to the west.

In little time, the fire was upon them. In his account, Thenon dwells especially on the differences between his men: on those who remained as “cool and calm as if this were an everyday occurrence,” and helped him to get everyone into the stream, and covered by wet blankets,” and on those who grew too agitated to be of any use. Of these, some ran to extremes. “I found that two of the men had completely lost their minds,” Thenon explains. “One of them (the crew’s cook) had become violently insane and three men were trying to hold him and to lay him down in the creek. The other one was dancing around and singing a lullaby. I set the lullaby boy down in the deepest water and told him to stay there and throw a wet blanket over his head.”

As the fire began to pass over them—a wall of “heat so intense” it took away Thenon’s breath—he notes: “The lullaby boy (I did not know his name) was still singing and now and then calling out for someone to throw another bucket of water on him.” 

As I read about the lullaby boy, I thought of Shakespeare’s Ophelia, lying in a different stream, singing. 

>*Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,                                                                          
>As one incapable of her own distress...*

Another young person caught up in a situation beyond their control that beggars comprehension.

### 3. 10 a.m.

.

In the wake of 1910’s Great Fire—as a direct consequence of the death and destruction it caused—the fledgling Forest Service successfully petitioned Congress for funding to manage wildlands across the West and keep them from ever burning so fiercely again. Ferdinand Silcox, a quartermaster in the region during the Great Fire who would go on to become Chief of the Forest Service, published a paper in November 1910 called How the Fires Were Fought. In their entry on the 1910 Fire, the Forest History Society neatly summarizes Silcox’s argument by explaining his belief “that the best way to prevent such a disaster in the future was to apply enough science, technology, and manpower to the problem, [because] fire should and could be eliminated from the landscape.” The Great Fire, the horror of it, and the economic loss, were used as incitement to establish a “total suppression,” or “10:00 a.m. policy,” so-called because it dictated that any wildfire reported on American soil should be put out by no later than 10 a.m. the following morning.

In order to pursue this policy, roads would need to be built into wilderness, and infrastructure of all kinds developed in every isolated reach of canyon and forest. In North Idaho, a number of “Timber Protective Associations” were founded, alongside the growing Forest Service agency, beginning in 1905, and accelerating after the Great Fire. These associations are essentially donation-based, non-governmental groups of firefighters, funded largely by the timber companies and other private landowners. An amalgamation of a number of these associations, called the Clearwater-Potlatch Timber Protective Association (CPTPA), still exists (as a 501(c)(4)). They send qualified firefighters around the country as needed, and on their website claim to protect 988,828 acres of Idaho forest. 

{% include essay/marginnote-image.html id="tellus-note" text="Coeur d'Alene Timber Protective Association Fifth Annual Report" image="cda_tpa1910"%}


For decades, the Timber Protective Agencies pursued their goal of suppressing every fire in “its infancy” in relative peace. But beginning in the mid-twentieth century, scientists started to recognize and accept what people Indigenous to the West had known all along—that it was a huge mistake to pursue a policy of total suppression; that regular burning is essential to prevent catastrophic fires. The Forest Service began to adjust some of their policies accordingly. But the Timber Protective Associations’ allegiance is still to their funders—and they seem to have no interest in updating their methods. “It's all in the name,” Jodi Walker wrote in the Lewiston Tribune in 2001. “Let others talk of fire as a tool, a method of forest management or a necessary evil.” Walker goes on to quote Rusty Eck, program planner for the CPTPA: “‘The whole point of this association has, is and will be quick initial attack. To Potlatch and the state of Idaho this [the forest] is just cropland and we are trying to protect their investment.’” 

Even now, the mission statement on their website hasn’t changed. As Eck says: “‘When something works, it's awful hard to fix it … We’ve been in business a long time.’”

By the logic they have been using for the last hundred years, CPTPA’s policy does make sense. To the vast majority of the white settlers of the Northwest’s forests, the trees were a financial asset, above all else. Some, including Elers Koch, thought from the beginning that the forest had value in and of itself as wilderness, and that some degree of burning was essential to preserve its “natural” state (though even he did not understand the way it had been managed pre-colonization). But forestry itself was a nascent discipline in the early 20th century, and, over time, those who thought like Koch lost out to those who favored total suppression and believed that everything wild should be tamed, and, ideally, turned into profit. 

In his 1944 book Burning an Empire: the story of American forest fires, Stewart Holbrook quotes Ernest Swift, acting conservation director for Wisconsin: “I firmly believe that Americans should feel that every foot of land we possess as a nation has [financial] value, that there is a possible utilization for all of it.”

### 4. Three Fires

.

It was and continues to be attitudes like Swift’s—the idea that every single natural resource can and should be harvested for financial profit—that changed the climate, and led to the age that scientists are calling the Anthropocene. Fire historian Stephen Pyne, however, argues that the Pyrocene would be a more appropriate name for our time, for the landscapes born of the Industrial Revolution.

In his book-length essay, The Pyrocene, Pyne explains that unlike the other classical elements, fire as we define it actually cannot exist without life, without the combination of oxygen and the carbon-based, organic molecules of which all living things are composed. Fire appeared as soon as plants colonized continents, and, as far as we know now, it cannot be found on any other planet in the universe. Pyne divides fire on Earth into three types: “first-fire” is the naturally occurring fire that appeared with the first life, the fire that lightning starts on the mountain, that burns until the rain puts it out.

“Second-fire,” according to Pyne, is the fire that hominins learned to use, work with, tame. We became what we now consider “human” because we learned to cook our food with fire and use fire to warm our hairless bodies. We fought wars with fire and lit our way with torches. We also learned to use fire to burn fields and wild places in order to promote the growth of food plants, and we started burning wild landscapes in controlled ways, to prevent the kinds of conflagrations that we see today. These practices of lighting intentional fires to promote the health of a landscape and the people who live there are now referred to as cultural burning. Yet critically, until the Industrial Revolution, “Human-kindled fires burned as first-fires did, in living landscapes, subject to shared conditions and constraints.” No matter how large they grew, Pyne explains, they would always run out of fuel eventually; the rain could always douse them, even if it took some time. They existed within biological limits, and this kept them from growing so large that they could, for example, significantly change the composition of the atmosphere in fifty years. 

This is because the effluent of first and second fires disappears into the sky, or is returned to the soil, as vital nutrients. People indigenous to ecosystems that rely on fire understand this. In her MS thesis, Nez Perce Perspectives on Fire Management, written at Washington State University, Daniella Drader explains: “Fire ‘makes new life’ and Nez Perce understand the intricate balance between the tool and their own survival.” Drader goes on to quote one of the interviewees in her study: “‘[fire] provides habitat for the deer and the elk...brings nutrients into the earth...herbs and medicines that we use and the foods that we eat start to thrive after fire goes through...it benefits us.’” Drader explains: “When fire is viewed as part of a whole (e.g. in conjunction with other elements) and is considered sacred, management is impacted. Fire transitions from just being a tool to becoming personal, like a relationship.”

For many years, humans and fire developed these kinds of relationships all over the world. The centrality of this kind of fire to the human narrative is evident in our myths. “Over and again,” Pyne explains, “origin myths speak to a frail and threatened species that became powerful only when it acquired fire.” Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity, the foundation of civilization in Greek myth. This story is so common around the world that it has its own category in the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, and variations are told by the tribes of the Northwest. 

Even beyond the realm of myth, fire infuses our languages. We use it as a metaphor for the other things that we are evolved to care most about—the spread of disease, of love, of rumors, of war. 

But when certain people started to set what Pyne calls “third-fire,” it changed the relationship. 

Third fire is the fire that burned once humans learned to take carbon-based fuel from the geologic past—originally, coal and oil—and burn it in the present, to power machines. Third fire was born of European thought during the period known as the “Age of Enlightenment” (but which Pyne calls “fire’s dark age”) and the Industrial Revolution. Pyne explains: “Third fire burns lithic landscapes no longer bounded by such ecological limits as fuel, season, sun, or the rhythms of wetting and drying. The source of combustibles is essentially unbounded; the problem is the sinks, where to put all the effluent.” The effluent of “third fire” is the atmospheric carbon dioxide responsible for changing the climate.

“Third-fire unhinged not only climate and biotas, but the affinity between people and fire,” Pyne explains. “Second-fire was an act of domestication … Both fire and people spread in a kind of mutual assistance pact. There was a fundamental inequality in their relationship because fire could exist without humans while humans could not exist without fire. But each operated within common conditions.” It wasn’t until they created third fire that humans—specifically, humans of European origin—unleashed something new on the planet, the consequences of which they could not imagine. 

A large part of the problem came from the way that industrialization and colonization worked together to spread the Northern European fire ethos around the world. Northern Europe, Pyne explains, is actually one of the only regions on Earth that doesn’t rely on fire to balance its ecosystems. Perhaps as a consequence of this, Northern Europeans believed that fire made a “good servant but a bad master.” While many people understood themselves and fire to be in a mutual relationship, Northern Europeans saw it as a hierarchy, and wanted to be on top. 

Because Northern Europeans could not understand that fire might be good for a landscape, they outlawed cultural burning practices in all of the places that they colonized, including the Northwestern U.S.. As Emily Washines, a scholar and Yakama Nation tribal member, explains, “This [the lighting of intentional fire] was noted in the 1850s through different journals from non-Natives. It was really a source of confusion on their part for not knowing why we did that. To them, we were just burning things up for no reason and it was very peculiar that they would be walking through areas that were charred. They didn't understand why.” Over time, Pyne goes on to explain, people in industrialized regions began demonizing all kinds of fire, and not just cultural burning. As technologies advanced, cultures that still relied on fire for cooking and warmth were labeled backward and primitive, dirty, undeveloped.

This is because “developed” people had started burning their fires far away from their bodies—at coal power plants, in the engines of cars and trains. To my mind, this is reminiscent of other troubling separations inherent to our globalized production systems: the way that most of us can no longer kill our own meat, though we’re happy enough to eat it; the way that we buy goods made in factories with inhumane working conditions, because they are ten thousand miles off, and we never see them. The fires burn night and day, and we can cool and heat and light our homes, order packages of goods from across the ocean that were made and transported by nothing but a series of burnings—and we never have to see the smoke, or fear that our children will stray too near the flames. 

“When we” (and by “we,” it should be clarified, Pyne seems to mean humans of European origin) “shifted to burning fossil biomass, the shock caused cultural amnesia about our heritage of fire,” Pyne explains. “We replaced or suppressed our traditional knowledge, and our felt understanding of how fire worked in such settings, much as we replaced the hearth with a propane heater and chandeliers with fluorescent lighting … Taking fuels out of the geologic past, burning them in the present, and releasing their by-products to a geologic future—this is fire’s new narrative arc and one of the grand markers in Earthly history.” 

By the time conversations about fire management were being had in the Western U.S., in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cultural amnesia of the white foresters was complete. In their minds, there were only two alternatives left: let fire burn unmitigated in wilderness, as they assumed it always had done, before their arrival, or suppress it completely.

### 5. Two Brains 

.

In the 1980s, an Oxford literary scholar and philosopher, Iain McGilchrist, was troubled by the fact that his age’s approach to literary scholarship felt so analytical, disembodied, and lacking in emotional nuance. In an effort to get closer to the body, he decided to retrain in medicine. He ended up specializing in psychiatry, and becoming a neuroimaging researcher at Johns Hopkins. While there, he focused his work on the differences between the right and left hemispheres of the human brain.

.

{% include essay/figure.html objectid="im-08" %}

Researchers at the time told him that this was a career dead-end. The original pop-psychology conception of the left and right brain (the left brain is logical; the right brain creative) had largely been debunked. Both hemispheres, experts said, work together on most things. This is still believed to be true—at least in people whose brains are uninjured, and working in the way that science assumes to be “normal.” But McGilchrist was drawn to research being done on patients who had sustained localized injuries to one hemisphere or the other, and were therefore functioning primarily with only one half of their brains. 

McGilchrist noticed that people who had left-hemisphere injuries struggled with speech, and certain mechanical tasks. But they could still relate to other human beings, appreciate beautiful music, literature, and nature, and understand subtle emotional context. People who had injured the right-hemisphere, on the other hand, struggled less with speech, and could complete more practical tasks. But they had lost the ability to understand nuance. In a way, they started to think more like machines and became inclined to lump things into broad categories. Their perspectives became more disembodied and disconnected from larger contexts. They also became more self-interested and had trouble relating to humans and other living things in an intersubjective way (in other words, as two conscious minds relate). They started relating to everything outside of themselves as if it were a lifeless object. 

This led McGilchrist and his fellow researchers to ask the question: since the hemispheres ideally do need to work together to function, why are they so physically divided in the first place? Wouldn’t more connections always be better and keep us more resilient in the face of these kinds of injuries? What is the evolutionary benefit of the disconnect?

The answer they came up with is that we are often called on to complete two incompatible tasks at the same time. One of these tasks will likely entail focusing narrowly on something that we want to get, hunt, or construct. But if we only use this kind of attention, we will miss everything else going on around us. We need an additional kind of attention working at the same time, taking in the larger context, responding to people, animals, plants and dangers, in nuanced and embodied ways. 

In his 2009 book The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World, McGilchrist combines ideas from his literary studies with the findings from his neuroimaging studies on the divided brain. He proposes the theory that, throughout most of human evolution, the right hemisphere of the brain was essentially in the lead (in his nomenclature, “the master”) while the left hemisphere of the brain was there to assist with practical tasks (“the emissary”). But at some point in European history, their roles got reversed. The narrowly focused, mechanical left brain took control, and pushed the more holistic, compassionate right brain to the side. This accelerated during the Industrial Revolution—when machines, a left brain creation, became so powerful and so prevalent.

When I read Pyne’s theory of second and third fire, I immediately thought of McGilchrist’s descriptions of the left and right brain’s different ways of seeing and engaging with the world around them. It helped me understand second fire when I thought of it as existing in an intersubjective relationship with human beings, the kind of relationship that comes from engagement with the right hemisphere of the brain. As Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire expert in Canada, explains in Kuhn’s article, Fire is medicine’: “We coexist with fire, we need fire and fire needs us. It’s a different way of looking at the forest.” 

Third fire, on the other hand, and the machines in which it burns, feel to me like the products of the left hemisphere of the brain, and the amnesiac cultures which, as Pyne explains, lost their “felt” (embodied) sense of how to relate to fire, and came to see it as “a good servant, but bad master.” Similarly, you could argue that the urge to “protect” trees for economic reasons is driven by the left brain’s self-interest, and sense that it is entitled to profit from the objects in the world around it; while the urge to suppress all wildfire is the left-brain urge to fight and control what frightens it.

Experts in trauma are also researching the differences between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, and how they manifest in traumatized people. When a person is traumatized, particularly if they were traumatized in childhood, whole regions of the brain that are active in others may appear dark if their brains are scanned, while other unexpected regions light up. This goes some way toward answering the question put by Thenon (observer of the ‘lullaby boy’) about why some people remain cool in terrifying situations, while others end up panicked, or singing in the stream. It may have to do with the ways that trauma in childhood, or a lack thereof, shaped their brain.

When we experience something terrifying, experts say, it is immediately stored by the back right brain—the part that stores raw, unfiltered emotion. This part of the brain is so fast that we may never even process an experience consciously, before it is stowed away there, in darkness. 

This is a phenomenon that many now are familiar with—the suppression of traumatic memories. Yet, this instinct for suppression, though helpful in the short-term, can often lead to problems with memory, amnesia, and to explosive, erratic, or destructive behavior in the future. In that way, the suppression of trauma feels like a direct analogy, as well as an explanation, for the suppression of fire. 

In order to be processed, traumatic memories have to be unlocked from the back of the right brain and processed through the fronts of our right and left hemispheres. This is how we contextualize them, place them in the past, and, ultimately, make sense of them as a part of the ongoing narrative of our lives. Both hemispheres need to work together on this in order for it to be accomplished.

But in traumatized people, the hemispheres have even fewer connections than they do in others. The front of the right hemisphere tends to show up unusually dark on brain scans. With this pathway blocked, the front of the left brain can no longer makes sense of emotions in context. When it feels the fear emanating from the back of the right hemisphere—what we might call a flashback—all it can do is invent a story in order to keep itself safe. This story is usually driven by a mixture of terror and self-interest. 

When we try to understand fire with the frightened, disoriented, left hemisphere alone, we see it as the enemy, the object. We lose all conception of a past in which we might have existed in a different relationship to it. We decide that it is encroaching on our communities, our homes, and that we are entitled to control it. The extreme, reactionary, 10 a.m. policy, in response to the Great Fire of 1910, makes some sense in this light.

Unfortunately, when we sever ourselves from the past and opt for total suppression, we also lose any ability we might have had to predict the future. We exist on a free floating island of what feels like an unprecedented present. It may begin to seem like anything could happen. Like everything might burn.

In the end of his account, Thenon explains: “The cook's condition had improved so much that he had no further need of attention from us. However, he did not get back to a normal state while here, but I was informed some weeks later that he had entirely recovered.”

Of the other, we get only a sentence.

“The 'lullaby boy' was taken to an asylum.”

### 6. Archival Silence

.

This essay was largely born of an attempt to research the history of fire in the Northwest, using the University of Idaho’s library archives as a starting place. 

In the archives, one can find the beautiful photos and remarkable accounts of the 1910 fire. One can also find the pamphlets for Idaho’s Timber Protective Associations—which seem to me to be the embodiment of a specific brand of amnesiac, forever-present, subject-object thinking. 

In a series of yearly reports, preserved in the University of Idaho’s Special Collections, the Associations’ Fire Wardens call for increasingly more funds, tools, and supplies in order to suppress, “in its infancy,” every single fire.

And yet, like most historical artifacts, the pamphlets might also help us to avoid a similarly myopic perspective on our own time. 

In the 1918 annual report from the Pend d’Oreille Timber Protective Association, the Fire Warden says the drought is terrible, the worst he’s seen since 1910. They are terrified, all summer, by the prospect of a fire starting, because most of the able men are mobilized in France, in the trenches of the First World War. Others, of course, will soon be dying in the 1918 epidemic of influenza.

This 1918 report in particular throws 2020 into a different perspective.

In the 1922 report published by the Priest Lake Timber Protective Association, the Fire Warden says the smoke was laying so thick upon the land that, by early July, the fire lookouts were totally useless. Just a sea of white. Not a drop of rain.

All of the 1920s, in fact, were plagued by drought and large fires that raged.

Of course, this is decidedly not to suggest that climate change isn’t real, or that droughts and heat waves in the West are not growing more intense and more common. All of that, too, is a part of the Pyrocene. But if there’s anything that can be learned from the early firefighters of the Northwest, it is this: suppression never works. Not of fires. Not of stories. Not of memories. Not of fear. And most definitely not of history—not of complicating, temporally expansive context. 

One thing is notably missing from the University of Idaho’s archives. Though the university sits on the homelands of the Nimiipuu (Nez Perce), Palus (Palouse) and Schitsu’umsh (Coeur d’Alene) tribes, it lacks any historical artifacts or accounts that relate to the relationships between these tribes and fire. 

On the one hand, this makes sense. There’s a deeply understandable lack of trust, and desire not to give Indigenous knowledge and artifacts to colonial institutions that will, at best, ignore or misuse them.

But it feels important to acknowledge their absence. Today, Indigenous perspectives on fire are more valued by the colonial society than they ever have been before—a value arguably born of necessity and terror. But it feels important to acknowledge their absence. Today, Indigenous perspectives on fire are more valued by the colonial society than they ever have been before—a value arguably born of necessity and terror. And yet, these perspectives can still make certain people uncomfortable, and complicate what might otherwise seem like simple questions. 

One of these questions is whether or not we have a right to expect that our homes won’t burn. As Drader explains, “A central concept in traditional Nez Perce fire knowledge is that fire cannot be ‘owned’ (interviewee) or controlled: ‘if the fire is naturally started, like through lightning...[residents] can’t live in a dangerous area and expect...the Forest Service to come and put the fire out just because you have your house there’ (interviewee). Thus, in the Nez Perce view, people who live in fire prone areas accept a certain level of risk.” 

In other words, it’s important to remember that we are living in fire’s home, not the other way around. If the arrival of fire surprised us, it’s not because it was unexpected; it’s because we were immersed in an amnesiac culture all along.

### 7. Clearings

.

{% include essay/figure.html objectid="im-09" %}

Almost more than fire, I think, people today are afraid of the smoke. It feels like a hallmark of a polluted, post-industrial landscape run out of control. 

And yet most cultures the world over (even in Europe, if you go back far enough) view fire and even smoke as cleansing. 

In a direct way, fire is: heat kills germs. From the perspective of the people indigenous to the West, it also plays a cleansing role in ecosystems—enriching soil, killing moss that chokes trees, removing invasive and flammable undergrowth. It spurs germination of the native species evolved to need fire to grow, and keeps the fuel load, dead or dying plant matter, from building up to the point that wildfire runs out of control. In a 2022 article published in Nature, Jude Coleman quotes Rod Mendes, a member of the Karuk Tribe and the fire chief for the Yurok Tribe Fire Department: “When I was a little kid, my grandmother used to burn around the house. She [said she] was just keeping the place clean.” 

In British Columbia, Kelly Boutsalis explains, in “The art of fire: reviving the Indigenous craft of cultural burning,” the Tsilhqot’in word for fire translates to “lightening the load off the land.”

But in fact, smoke, too, has long been an important feature of summer in the Northwest, and was seen as a cleanser, served a cleansing purpose. Smoke can reflect sunlight and cool river water, which is good for salmon. Research has also shown that light diffused by smoke actually increases photosynthesis in certain plant species, while it renders summer heat less withering. 

Of course, a sky full burning plastic, and whatever chemical nightmares today go up in flames, is not quite the same as one that is mostly fir needles, moss, and sage. Fires now burn hotter, longer, and produce more smoke, because of the heat, and the droughts, and the hundred-year fuel buildup that colonial land management created.

And yet. 

There is something about the idea of smoke as cleanser that stirs and surprises my brain more than any other fact I’ve learned about the history of the Western firescape. Confined to my house, with the smoke erasing light, shadow, gradation, I find it easier than ever to feel trapped in a kind forever-present of fear and disorientation. It feels like the smoke is increasing as a presence in the air, a direct reflection of summers growing hotter and dryer. But in fact, most of the 20th and early 21st centuries were times of unusually smoke-free skies. 

As Pyne writes: “…while wildfires gather more and more media attention, the amount of land actually burned overall is shrinking … California experienced 4.2 million burned acres in 2020; in preindustrial times, it would have known probably over 10 million acres burned though not burned in wild surges.” The same is true throughout the Northwest.

This, Indigenous fire scholars argue, needs to happen again if we want to rebalance our ecosystems. In a 2019 article, “Indigenous fire practices once shaped the Northwest—and they might again,” Manola Secaira quotes Cody Desautel, natural resource director of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in eastern Washington: “…[W]e need to shift perspective away from trying to stop fires to making sure that we're doing fuels treatments and forest health treatments throughout the year to make sure that when fire comes, you can have a resilient landscape that can respond to fire.” Several organizations, some affiliated with tribes, are offering trainings in setting “good fires.” In a 2020 essay, “Good Fire on the Klamath,” non-native fire practitioner and historian, Jared Dahl Aldern, asked Bill Tripp, of the Karuk Tribe Natural Resources Department, about the danger of these non-tribal collaborations perpetuating forms of colonialism. Though of course this may not be a universal perspective, Aldern explains that Tripp feels it comes down to what is best for the land: “‘Our creation stories tell me it’s my responsibility to care for the land, and it’s my responsibility to do what I need to do to get that work done.’” Aldern goes on to explain: “Karuk people … operate under the assumption that as more people may come to live in Karuk homelands, they ought to engage in reciprocal support with tribes and uphold Indigenous people’s rights to do the things they have always done there, including the right to sustain an appropriate relationship with fire.”

At the end of September 2020, when smoke had been blotting out the sun for months, Aldern published another essay called “Where There’s Good Fire, There’s Good Smoke.” In it, he resists the perspective that so many during that time took—that the smoke was an enemy, frightening.

“During a rainy spell,” Aldern explains, “I sometimes get to the point of thinking, “‘You know, I sure am tired of all this rain, but I know we need it — for now I’ll stay inside or, if I need to go out, I’ll throw on a raincoat or grab an umbrella, just in case I need it.’ If we can get through our current pandemic of wildfires and their lethal smoke-storms, and if Indigenous people can re-establish their cultural fire regimens, perhaps, during a future smoky spell, I’ll be able to start to say to myself, ‘You know, I sure am tired of all this smoke, but I know we need it — for now I’ll stay inside or, if I need go out (maybe even to see if I can pitch in and help with the burns), I’ll grab an N95 mask, just in case I need it.’”

Maybe I love this just because I’m the person perennially nagging people not to complain about rain in the West. But there’s also a lightness, a practicality in it—a gentle call to exit the subject-object relationship to smoke, yet in a way that’s human, that’s not asking too much. Many of the problems we currently face are overwhelming, and enormous, and frightening to take on. But in this, and in those returning to their traditions of cultural burning, something begins to clear a little. It starts to feel possible to imagine a future in the Pyrocene.
