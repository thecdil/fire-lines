In a 2021 piece of investigative journalism produced by PBS, Frank Lake, a forest scientist,  holder of traditional knowledge, and descendant of the Karuk Tribe (whose lands are in what is colonially considered far northern California, near the border with Oregon), is quoted as saying: "We have to question the narrative of history that has demonized fire, coming from a colonial perspective." 

Lake could easily be speaking to the whole history of European colonization; but in the article, he happens to be referring to the fallout of a specific, formative event — many have said the most formative, when it comes to shaping the modern firescape of the American West: the Great Fire of 1910. 

The Great Fire (also sometimes called the Big Burn, Big Blowup, or the Devil's Broom Fire) began with many small fires as early as June, and reached its climax on the 20th of August, with the arrival of wild Palouser winds. It burned a still-astonishing three million acres across Idaho, western Montana, and eastern Washington in only two days. 

A 1911 paper, *Handling the Fire Peril*, called 1910 "probably the worst fire year in American history — a year when no rain fell for months, when the winds were veritable hurricanes, when fires sprang up everywhere and were numbered not by hundreds but by thousands..." The forester Edward G. Stahl wrote of flames "hundreds of feet high and fanned by a tornadic wind so violent that the flames flattened out ahead, swooping to earth in great darting curves, truly a veritable red demon from hell." The smoke could be seen in New England — while soot settled as far away as Greenland. The silver-mining town of Wallace, Idaho was largely destroyed, and several smaller towns were burned down to nothing.

Firsthand accounts of the event tend to focus on the terror of it. At least eighty-five people died. And, with fear, many more reportedly lost their minds.

Two men leapt up before their companions and ran right into the flames — for once, the moth is no metaphor — though I do not suppose that they had mistaken the fire's light for the moon (as moths are supposed to do). 

One man slipped off into the darkness, as "columns of smoke," which often "burst into flames, shot thousands of feet" into the sky. "Even though two shots were heard," we learn, from a firsthand account of the incident, "it was not understood until the following morning that he had taken his own life."

Another group of nineteen men, "thoroughly panic stricken," broke off from the rest of their crew — in fear, disobeying their captain — and took refuge in a "little cabin." Eighteen of those men were lost to the flames, and were found the next day — along with five horses and "a large black bear," who had all perished in the same place. 

The story of a man named Ed Thenon — captain of the Moose Creek Crew — gripped me, I guess you could say, the most. Thenon went to bed with his men in darkness and quiet, imagining them all to be many miles from the line of the fire. A little after 10 p.m., one of Thenon's crew called him out of his tent — to observe what he thought must be stars, falling on a hillside to the west. 

In little time, the fire was upon them. In his account, Thenon dwells especially on the differences between his men: on those who remained as "cool and calm as if this were an everyday occurrence," and helped him to get everyone into the stream, and covered by wet blankets," and on those who grew too agitated to be of any use. Of these, some ran to extremes. "I found that two of the men had completely lost their minds, Thenon explains. "One of them (the crew's cook) had become violently insane and three men were trying to hold him and to lay him down in the creek. The other one was dancing around and singing a lullaby. I set the lullaby boy down in the deepest water and told him to stay there and throw a wet blanket over his head."

As the fire begins to pass over them — a wall of "heat so intense" it took away Thenon's breath — he notes: "The lullaby boy (I did not know his name) was still singing and now and then calling out for someone to throw another bucket of water on him." 

As soon as I read about the lullaby boy, I thought of Shakespeare's Ophelia, lying in a different stream, singing.

> As one incapable of her own distress...

Another young person caught up in a situation beyond her control — that beggars comprehension.
