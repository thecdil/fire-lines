# About Fire Lines

This essay connects the Confluence Lab’s [Stories of Fire](https://www.theconfluencelab.org/stories-of-fire-atlas) project and the [“Big Burn” collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/bigburn/) in the University of Idaho Library’s Special Collections & Archives. 

The goal of the Confluence Lab is to take an an interdisciplinary, humanities-based approach to environmental issues impacting communities in the rural Northwest. An archive has many purposes, but one is to keep the past alive so that it may be allowed explain the present, and influence the future. 

The essay introduces threads from the archival material, alongside Indigenous fire knowledge, ideas from Western science—both historical and current—literature, psychology, and history in an effort to understand the lasting effects of 1910’s Great Fire on the landscapes of the Northwest.

## About The Project

Fire Lines was written by Isabel Marlins as an MFA internship project in 2022/23 with support from [Leah Hampton](https://leahkhampton.com/) (Environmental Humanities and Creative Writing Fellow in Residence at the Confluence Lab) and [Evan Peter Williamson](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/ewilliamson.html) (Co-Director of the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/)).
The web site was built using a customized [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) template with features to support a multimodal essay weaving the presentation writing and archival objects together.
