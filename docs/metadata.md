# Metadata Standards for CB-CSV

See general documentation: <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/>

## Required fields

- `objectid`: unique string, all lowercase with no spaces or special characters as it will used to form the itemâ€™s URL. Underscores (_) and dashes (-) are okay; slashes (/) should NOT be used in this field. Objects without an objectid will not be displayed in the collection. Objects with non-unique objectid will be overwritten.
- `title`: string description of object, used through out the template in representations of the object. *A title is not technically required, but will leave blanks areas in the template.*

## Object Download and Display images

- `object_location`: a full URL to download the full quality digital object or relative path if items are contained with in the project. This file is not used for display on the website, except in the case of image galleries on item pages.
- `image_small`: a full URL to a small image representation of the object or relative path if items are contained with in the project. If this field is filled, the image will be displayed to represent the item on Item pages or in features added to content pages.
- `image_thumb`: a full URL to a thumb image representation of the object or relative path if items are contained with in the project. If this field is filled, the image will be displayed to represent the item on visualization pages.
- `format`: object's MIME media type. If an object does not have an image_thumb, format is used by template logic to switch between different icons.

Each object will likely have an object_location value, the link where the digital file can be downloaded (or potentially accessed in a different platform). 
It is not a required field--items without an object_location will become metadata only records.

For display images in various visualization pages the template checks the fields image_thumb for links to image derivatives (Browse, Map, Timeline).
If image_thumb derivatives are not available (i.e. the field is left blank), the logic will select icons alternatives based on the display_template or format field.
If the item has neither display_template or format, it will fall back to a default icon.

These fields should be filed out in your spreadsheet using formulas / recipes depending on where your objects are hosted. 
This provides flexibility to include objects from multiple sources and to generate the URLs using a variety of approaches without needing to modify the template code.
CollectionBuilder-CSV aims to provide API recipes to generate the links for a variety of hosting solutions--but this work is done on the metadata, not embedded in the collectionbuilder-csv template code logic.

If the objects are included within the project repository use the relative path starting with `/` from the root of the repository. 
For example if some images are in the "objects" folder, use a relative path, e.g. `/objects/example_object.jpg`.
The relative path will be converted into a full URL during build.
Do not include the `baseurl` value that you set in "_config.yml", since this will be added by the template.

## Object Template

- `display_template`: a template type used in logic to set up different Item page features. If blank the object will default to a generic item page. Default supported options: `image`,`pdf`, `video`, `audio`,  `record`, `item`. See docs/item-pages.md for details.
