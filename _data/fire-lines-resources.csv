Halm; Mr. Swaine,"R1-78-30, United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Idaho Panhandle National Forests","Introduction from the book: ""If history is not written it is soon forgotten. The 1910 forest fire in the Northern Rocky Mountain Region is an episode which has had much to do with shaping the fire policy not only of that region but the whole United States. The tragic and disastrous culmination of that battle to save the forests shocked the nation into a realization of the necessity of a better system of fire control.

It is now thirty-two years since that memorable summer. The men who took part in the campaign are getting older each year and before many more years have elapsed the 1910 fire season will be only a tradition. For this reason the writer who, as Supervisor of the Lolo Forest, had some small part in the campaign and the background of a current knowledge of the regional situation through those trying days, has undertaken to compile an informal record of the fire history of that year. This is not written for publication, but primarily as a record for the Forest Service, so that the story will not be lost.""",Idaho; Western Montana,,,,,pdf,application/pdf,https://thecdil.github.io/fire-lines/objects/thumbs/when-the-mountains-roared_th.jpg,https://thecdil.github.io/fire-lines/objects/small/when-the-mountains-roared_sm.jpg,https://thecdil.github.io/fire-lines/objects/When-the-Mountains-Roared.pdf

However, barriers and constraints to inclusion of diverse stakeholders' viewpoints exist. Natural resource researchers have attempted to uncover barriers to inclusive participation, but much of that research has come from the perspectives of the dominant culture. This study identifies barriers that inhibit a ccess to and participation in current fire management programs as told from the perspectives and experiences of members of the Nez Perce Tribe on their reservation. Co-cultural theory, muted group theory, and standpoint theory were used as th eoretical fra meworks to analyze in-depth grounded theory style interviews with the Nez Perce Tribal members. The results demonstrate that both land agencies and Nez Perce create barriers to the inclusion of Nez Perce traditional fire knowledge in contemporary federal fire management practices. Primary barriers are id entified. This paper demonstrates how these barriers impact fire program participation and highlights some of the traditional Nez Perce fire knowledge. Implications for research and professional practice are explored.""",Pacific Northwest,Nez Percé Indians--Attitudes.;Fire management--Study and teaching.;Fire prevention--Study and teaching.;Traditional ecological knowledge;Pacific Northwest,,,,record,record,,,https://hdl.handle.net/2376/100561
