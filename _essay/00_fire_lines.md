> *Traditional Fire Knowledge is conveyed by the oral traditions that show how to perceive the phenomena of fire. Yet it is not just the phenomena of fire as it stands alone. The stories relate to how to value the relationship between fire and people. We offer it our commitment of respect and it offers to take care of us by warming us and cooking food. The Traditional Fire Knowledge is put into practice each time we use it because we remember the relationship as conveyed by the stories.*
